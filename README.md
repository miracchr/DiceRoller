# DiceRoller
In this mini project, we will create an object-oriented software product in Android Studio containing two activities and one type of sensor. We want to focus on solving the problem that occurs when you want to play a game that requires you to have dice but does not have any at hand.
The purpose of the app is to provide the user with two regular dice, that can be rolled and show a randomized number of eyes between 1 and 6, giving the same impression as rolling a regular dice.
The first activity will act as a starting screen that will present the name of the application, some dice images, and a button that will let the user continue. The second activity will then present firstly the unrolled dice on the screen, then when the phone is shaken, an animation of the dice rolling will be played and lastly the dice will show a random set of eyes.
Sensing when the dice should be rolled will be done using the gyroscope sensor in the Android device and the illustration of the dice rolling will be done in pixel art.
